      <h2>About Baking</h2>
      <p>Baking is an ancient cooking method that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, to cook foods like bread, cakes, and pastries. Heat is transferred to the food via convection and conduction, which triggers chemical reactions that transform ingredients like flour, sugar, eggs, and leavening agents into a solid structure with a firm crust and soft interior. Common ingredients and techniques include flour for structure, sugars for flavor and browning, eggs as binders, and fats for tenderness, while techniques like creaming and kneading are used to develop texture and gluten.  </p>

        <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
  History of Soft Rolls
  </p>  
       The history of soft rolls dates back to ancient Egypt, where early forms of leavened bread were created. Over time, techniques for making lighter, airier rolls evolved in Europe, especially in places like Germany and Austria. The 19th and 20th centuries saw the rise of commercial baking and mass production, making soft rolls widely available, and specific types like the Parker House roll became American staples.

<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
  Ingredients
</p>
<p>2 cups all-purpose flour</p>
<p>2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
<p>¾ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>¾ cup (150g) sugar</p>
<p>2 large eggs</p>
<p>¾ cup (180ml) milk,</p>
 <p>room temperature</p>
<p>½ cup (114g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled</p>
<p>1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Optional: ½ cup (100g) chocolate chips or fruit for mix-ins</p>



        <p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
  Procedure
</p>

<p>Step 1</p>
<p> Combine Milk, Sugar, and Butter
Add milk, sugar, and butter pads to a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high for 1 minute. Stir and let cool until the temperature reaches 105-110°F.</p>
      
   <img src="Step1.jpg" alt="Step1">   
    
   <p>Step 2</p>
 <p>Proof the Yeast
Pour the milk mixture into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Sprinkle yeast on top and gently stir. Let sit for 10 minutes or until foamy. The warm water activates the yeast, so be diligent about checking for the right temperature. You need to be somewhere between 100-110°F .</p>

<img src="Step2.jpg" alt="Step2"> 

<p>Step 3</p>
 <p>Make the Dough
Slowly mix in the egg (beaten) and salt. Set the mixer to medium-low speed and slowly add flour (1 cup at a time) until the dough comes together and starts to pull away from the sides of the mixing bowl.</p>

<img src="Step3.jpg" alt="Step3"> 

 <p>Step 4</p>
<p> Knead the Dough
Allow the mixer to knead the dough on medium-low speed for 3 more minutes or knead by hand for 8 minutes. The dough should be sticky but not so sticky that it clings to your fingers just barely sticks.</p>

   <img src="Step4.jpg" alt="Step4">
   
   <p>Step 5</p>
<p>Let the Dough Rise
Transfer the dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size. The dough will rise more quickly in a warm environment, so keep it in a draft free location</p>

<img src="Step5.jpg" alt="Step5">


  <p> Step 6</p>
<p>Shape the Dough Balls
Gently punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide into 15 equal pieces and then shape into smooth dough balls.</p>

<img src="Step6.jpg" alt="Step6">

<p>Step 7</p>
<p>Second Rise
Place in a greased 9 x 13-inch baking dish with each dough ball equally spaced apart. Cover with a sheet of greased plastic wrap and place in a warm spot to rise for 1 hour or until they have doubled in size.</p>

<img src="Step7.jpg" alt="Step7">

<p>Step 8</p>
<p> Bake the Rolls
Bake for 16-20 minutes until rolls are cooked through and tops are golden brown. Be careful not to overbake or the rolls may turn out tough and dry.</p>

<img src="Step8.jpg" alt="Step8">

<p>Step 9</p>
<p>Brush with Butter
Remove from oven and immediately brush the tops with melted butter. Allow to cool for a couple minutes before serving.</p>

  History of Chocolate Muffin
</p>  
   
   <hr>The history of the chocolate muffin is intertwined with the evolution of the American-style muffin, which developed from earlier English muffins in the 19th century. While the term "muffin" dates to at least the 11th century in Wales, the inclusion of chocolate, particularly through the invention of the chocolate chip in the 1930s, transformed the muffin into a common sweet treat.  Origin of the muffins


The origins of muffins date back to Europe. The word "muffin" is thought to have originated from the French term "moufflet", which meant soft bread. However, the modern muffin as we know it today was developed in the United States in the 19th century. English immigrants brought traditional recipes for muffins, but American versions soon appeared, creating a denser, sweeter and more cake-like texture.

Maffins are appreciated in different parts of the world and their popularity transcends geographical boundaries. In North America, muffins are a common breakfast ingredient. They are often enjoyed with a cup of coffee or tea and are available in bakeries, cafés and grocery stores. In the UK, muffins are usually baked, split and spread with butter or jam. They are an important part of the traditional afternoon tea.

There are many topping options for muffins. Popular toppings for sweet muffins are streusel (a crumble of flour, sugar and butter), cinnamon sugar, icing sugar, glazes (such as lemon or chocolate) or even a drizzle of honey. Sweet muffins can also have delicious fillings such as chocolate chips, blueberries, raspberries, bananas, nuts or dried fruit to add flavour and texture. For a richer flavour, top them with fruit or sweet toppings.

Savoury muffins are less common, but just as impressive. These versions often contain ingredients such as cheese, herbs, vegetables or meat. Toppings for savoury muffins can be grated cheese, herbs, sun-dried tomatoes, chopped olives or even pesto. Savoury muffins are a great accompaniment to soups, stews or salads.

<p style="font-size: 24px; text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">
  History of Cinnamon Rolls
</p>    
        <hr>Cinnamon rolls originated in Northern Europe, likely Germany and Sweden, with the modern ver sio nemerging in the early 20th century after the spice trade made cinnamon more accessible to Europeans. The pastry, known as "kanelbulle" in Sweden, gained popullarity after World War I and spread to the U.S. with German and Swedish immigrants, where it evolved into the larger, often frosting-topped rolls common today. A cinnamon rolll (also known as cinnamon bun, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon scroll cinnamon Danish and cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll commonly served in Northern Europe and North America. A cinnamon roll consists of arolled sheet of yeast-leavened sweet bread doughor Viennoiserie, onto which a cinnamon and sugar mixture (with some variations including brown sugar, raisins or other ingredients) is sprinkled over a thin coat of butter. The dough is then rolled, cut into individualportions and normally baked, however a deep-fried version is called cinnamon roll or cinnamon bun doughnut.

Arab spice traders introduced the Sri Lankan cinnamon spice to Europe. The origin of cinnamon rolls is unknown but might be in Byzantium. The oldest recorded recipes for cinnamon rolls are from Germany inthe 16th century.

In Denmark the cinnamon roll is known as "kanelsneg", in Sweden it is called kanelbulle, in Norway it is known as kanelbolle, skilling sbolle, kanelsnurr, or kanel i svingene ene in in Finland it is known as korvapuusti, uusti in in Iceland it is known as kanilsnúður, and in Estonia it is known as kaneelirull. In Austria and Germany, it is called Zimtschnecke. In Slovakia and the Czech Republic, it is called škoricové slimáky/skořicoví šneci (meaning 'cinnamon snails).

American cinnamon rolls are frequently large, baked in a pan and topped with cream cheese icling (usually confectioners sugar-based) and are sometimes fried, finished withglaze, and served as a variation of a ralised donut. There are also regionall combinations: in the American Midwest, especially Nebraska and Kansas, cinnamon rolls are commonly eaten with chili. There are also regions that include bacon pieces.

In Asian cultures, cinnamon rolls may be made using a yeast bread technique called tangzhong The technique is closely associated with Japanese milk bread since it gives it a soft, feathery texture. By heating flour at exactly 65°Cor 149°, the starches within the flour will pre gelatinize, causing it to thicken more than average. Tangzhong allows the starches to retain moisture for longer periods of time, resulting ina longer shelf life.
